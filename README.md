# Multithreaded Data Processing Application

## Overview

This C++ application demonstrates multithreading for concurrent data processing. The application simulates data input from multiple sources and processes the data concurrently using multithreading.

## Compilation and Execution

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with C++11 support (e.g., g++)
- pthread library (for multithreading)

### Compilation

To compile the application, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -pthread Multithread_application.cpp -o Multithread_application

```
# Design Choices

## Multithreading
The application uses the C++11 standard for threading. It creates a specified number of threads to process data concurrently, improving performance.

## Data Processing
The `processData` function represents the data processing logic within each thread. It currently prints the processed data value and simulates processing time. You should customize this function to implement your specific data processing requirements.

## Synchronization
Synchronization is achieved using a mutex (`std::mutex`) to control access to shared data and a condition variable (`std::condition_variable`) to signal when data is available for processing. This ensures data integrity and avoids race conditions.

## Error Handling
Basic error handling is included. If an error occurs during thread creation, a message is printed to the standard error stream. For a production environment, more robust error handling and logging mechanisms should be implemented based on the specific requirements.

## Performance
The code includes a simple simulation of data processing time using `std::this_thread::sleep_for`. You can optimize the processing logic based on the specific performance requirements of your application.

## Documentation
The code is documented with comments to explain key sections and design choices. Review the comments for a better understanding of the implementation.

## Customization
- Adjust the number of threads (`numThreads`) and data items (`numDataItems`) in the `main` function based on your application's requirements.
- Replace the placeholder data processing logic in the `processData` function with your actual processing code.
